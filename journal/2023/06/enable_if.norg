* Possible implementation

@code cpp
template<bool B, typename T>
struct enable_if {}

template<typename T>
struct enable_if<true, T>
{
	typedef T type;
}
@end

  B is a boolean type that is responsible for verifying whether it is enabled or not.

  In this implementation, if the result of the check is /*true*/, you can access the T type, which can be utilized. 

  However, if the check /*fails*/, the {:template argument deduction:} also fails, resulting in a compilation error.

  This approach enables compile-time checks to ensure the validity of the code.
